Rule: Focus on "steps" Folder Modifications

All workflow modifications must be confined to the "steps" folder only.

DO NOT modify or generate any changes to configuration files such as:
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- types.d.ts

This rule ensures that Motia remains focused on the workflow steps, keeping project configuration files intact.
